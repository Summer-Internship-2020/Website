                <div id="Shi" class="collapse">
                    <p>We strive to deliver products purchased from Urban Wings in excellent condition and in the fastest time possible. If this is your first order with Urban Wings, shipping will be completely FREE. Also, for all the subsequent purchases of Rs. 1199* or more, we will deliver the order to your doorstep free of cost. A shipping charge of Rs. 149 will be applicable to all orders under Rs. 1199.</p>
                    <p>If the order is cancelled, lost or un-delivered to your preferred location, we will refund the complete order amount including any shipping charges, if paid online.
                        If you return an order delivered to you, order shipping charges will not be refunded. However if you self-ship your returns, we will reimburse self-shipment charges based on Urban Wings's Returns Policy. For accounts whose return behavior violate our fair usage policy, a delivery charge of Rs. 149 will be levied on all orders, irrespective of order value.</p>

                    <p>*Order value is calculated after applying discounts/VAT/GST or any other applicable charges.</p>

                    <p>We always strive hard to provide the best experience to our customers. However, we have noticed that few accounts abuse our liberal returns policy. These accounts typically return most of the items bought or choose to not accept our shipments. Hence, our regular customers are deprived of the opportunity to buy these items. To protect the rights of our customers, we reserve the right to collect shipping charge of Rs. 149 for all orders and disable cash on delivery option for accounts which have high percentage of returns and shipments not accepted by value of orders placed.</p>
